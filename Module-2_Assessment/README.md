#>"There's no Cryin in Baseball!"


###WHAT DOES THIS PROJECT DO?

This project is designed as a spin off of the traditional HangMan game that people have been
playing for many years. The main objective of the game is to guess the displayed word that has
been randomly selected from the word bank that has been instilled in the main code. You get 10 guesses
and each guess pertains to a letter in the puzzle that is denoted by an underscore.

###Why is this project useful?

This project is useful for displaying a demonstration of the usefulness of javascript in every day websites.
Though this is just a simple display of the many use cases of **javascript** it gives a pretty good insight
into how javascript can provide great functionality to somebody's web application.
